# ExampleRESTJava

Example of a REST web service in Java with CRUD operations over an object stored in a simple MySQL table of countries that's made up of three fields:

- id
- name
- capital

It's a Netbeans project so it's better to test it using that IDE. Insomnia is a great REST tester if you don't have one already (an addon for Chrome).
